This is a sample application. It's a pastebin inspired app. I store many code snippets and solutions in it.

It uses PHP Slim and PHP ActiveRecord.

To install :
  1. Install dependencies

      // n.b. if you don't have composer installed first run
      // curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

     composer.phar install  // if you have composer installed
 
  2. load the sql file
  3. update the config.php file (database and document root)
